		<h4>Alana Robyn Rosen</h4> <br>
		<h5>Founder of <strong>Yarntastic Adventures</strong></h5> <br>
		<p>I am a life-long weirdo who navigates the world with more chronic ailments than seems appropriate. I learned to crochet from YouTube in 2017 out of a strong desire to create and found something that I truly love. I’ve experimented with making hats, scarves, unicorns, seahorses, and my special <strong>Pride-O-Pusses</strong>.<br>
		In my spare time, I read, organize, and tend to my male rats whom I love a potentially unhealthy amount. I'm not a terribly social person, but I get along well with people when I accidentally stumble upon them.<br>
		<br>Navigating the world with chronic illness is a daily experiment, but between my crafts, my boys, and my disturbing sense of humor, we’re making it work several tiny steps at a time.</p>
