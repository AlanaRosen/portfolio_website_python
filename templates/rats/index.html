<h1 class="title">How I Ended Up with Twenty-Seven Rats</h1>

<div class="container-fluid" id="body"> <!--allows columns (text or image) to expand or shrink with screen-->
  <p>
    Well, in January of 2018, I was lonely. I am quite allergic to all animals (most plants and basic universal elements, as well), so I could not have a pet. It wasn't until one sad day when I posted on Facebook about my predicament that rats became an idea. I had several friends from high school tell me what excellent pets they made and how cuddly and personable they can be. At the time, it seemed like a decent idea, so I went for it. Little did I know, it would be one of the best decisions I have ever made.
  </p>
  <p>
    I went to a local pet store and bought three (I have OCD and can only deal with things in odd numbers - three being my favorite) feeder rats (the kind they usually keep for people with snakes). I requested three boys, as the research showed them to be much more calm and affectionate (the girls are smarter and easier to train - yes you can train rats - but I love my cuddlers). At the time, the store assistant told me, "Yeah, I think these are all boys."
  </p>
  <p>
    That should have been the biggest red flag in the history of ever, but I was too excited about my new babies to notice. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I took my gorgeous rats home and introduced them to their new cage and play area and watched them promptly escape from all of it. I spent months being outsmarted by three young rats (they weren't even full-grown yet, so they had to be less than six months old), and I am only slightly ashamed to admit that. It was after a couple months that I noticed two of my rats get suddenly rounder - not bigger, just round. I did some more research and discovered that I had been given two girl rats and one boy, and they were pregnant. The internet also informed me at that time that once rats are visibly pregnant, they will give birth within the week.
  </p> 
  <p>
    So, naturally, I panicked. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I got all the necessary supplies together, separated the preggos, and waited. For five days, I did not spend more than 90 minutes at a time sleeping for fear of missing the magical birth. I was quite cranky by the time the big moment came, but it was totally worth it. I watched my sweet girls (named Doyle and Faust) give birth, each of them to a dozen magnificent babes! I've never seen anything like it and I loved every second of it. It was only after the birth that I realized my wonderful little family had just gone from 3 to 27.
  </p>
  <p>
    I had 27 rats.
  </p> 
  <p>
    27.
  </p>
  <p>
    Twenty. Seven.
  </p>
  <p>
    After I relearned how to breathe, I started preparing several larger cages (improvising two of them out of my dresser which I dismantled for this purpose) in anticipation of the horde of rodents I now had on my hands. For the first three weeks, mommies and babies all stayed in the birthing cage together, constantly eating and sleeping and being just about the cutest things that have ever existed. Doyle and Faust decided early on that it would be easier to co-parent the babies than try to keep them separate (also, they kept stealing each other's babies thinking one of theirs had gotten out of the nest), so they would take turns nursing while the other escaped to a higher level to get some peace. Every single day, I got to hold and play with these delightful pups (I referred to them as wiggle-beans, which I feel is pretty appropriate), making sure they were all healthy and getting fed. By three weeks, they had grown so much that I had to move them to the larger cages and separate them. I had learned online that the sexes needed to be separated by six weeks, as they are sexually mature at that point and WILL start breeding. Luckily for me, even at three weeks, it was easy to tell which babies were boys and which were girls. Doyle stayed with her sons while I left Faust to handle the ladies.
  </p>
  <p>
    During their first six weeks, I frantically scrambled to find homes for all these rats! I struck gold through Facebook (again) and found several people to take a few each, which would slowly whittle my numbers considerably. Within a month of them being weaned, I was down to eleven rats (six girls not including the mothers and five boys including the father). I had grown so attached to these 11 that I simply could not give any more of them away.
  </p>
  <p>
    I probably should have mentioned this earlier, but I was in Ohio at this time.
  </p>
  <p>
    I moved from Cleveland, Ohio to St. Louis, MO with eleven rats. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Now, if I had gotten my boys fixed, I could have kept them in the same cage with their sisters and it would not have been a problem. However, I cannot even fathom how much money that would cost, so I came up with a different solution: Instead of having two large cages and eleven rats in my studio apartment (you can only imagine how difficult the smells were to combat), my partner, Cadale, took the six girls. Conveniently, he lives about two blocks down the road from me, so I get to visit my girls any time I like. The five boys stayed with me, and we all couldn't be a happier family.
  </p>
  <p>
    Needless to say, I have never been lonely again.

        My oldest boy is Scribe the Pagemaster&reg;. Scribe&reg; is actually the father of all my other boys, and he earned his name due to his affinity for gnawing on books while I read them. He is just a sleepy potato filled with the most content love I have ever seen in my life. He spends most of his time lounging around looking chunky or eating to maintain said chunk. Scribe&reg; loves to witness the world from a shoulder's perspective and will show his appreciation with kisses all over. He is the only remaining rat of my original three, and I feel I have the deepest bond with him. There is no more kind or gentle creature on this earth than my beloved Pagemaster&reg;.

        Next, there's Trinidad&reg;. Often preferring to keep his own company, Trinidad&reg; is more timid and reserved than the other boys. He is always cautious in leaving the cage and moves slowly and carefully on unfamiliar terrain. Owing to his size, Trinidad&reg; seems to be the second-in-command to Scribe&reg;, easily dominating the other sons with his determination and bulk. But don't think any of this makes him unfriendly! Once he feels comfortable, he can be a funny, sweet, love-y boy just like the rest.

        Third in command is Crimson&reg;, by far the most hyper of the bunch (which, honestly, is not saying a whole lot). He loves jumping around from hammock to hammock within his cage and takes absolutely every possible opportunity he can find to be held. Crimson&reg; is a born explorer and kiss fanatic - once he gets ahold of you, you are getting slathered in love and there is nothing you can do to stop that. Curiosity often gets the better of him, as Crimson&reg; has been known to make some terrifying leaps in order to sate his wandering mind. I definitely have to keep an eye on him.

        Tiger&reg; is fourth in the hierarchy and remains the rat most similar to a human that I think I have ever met. Something about his demeanor says that he knows what's going on and he's okay with it most of the time. He has always been a fairly content rat, seemingly needing nothing but love and lots of corn. As he ages, Tiger&reg; becomes more and more like his father every day, preferring now to nap rather than play around with his brothers. Whenever he is held, Tiger&reg; spends the majority of his time exploring my hair and ears as opposed to the world around him. His affection for me is blatant, as is mine for him. Tiger&reg; has always been outgoing and accepting and never turns down a cuddle pile. His cuteness knows no bounds, and he is always willing to share his bed with any and all oncomers.

      <div class="col-md-9" id="SnuggleBugInfo"> <!--defines the container size of the text (9 of 12) and when to change layout for smaller screen (md) -->
        Last but not least, we have Snuggle Bug&reg;. Snugs&reg; is the smallest of the boys, and I am thankful for that every single day. Not being the most elegant of creatures, I frequently find Snuggle Bug&reg; falling feet at a time after slipping off a platform or jumping to a hammock and missing. He loves to play with his brothers, but never really wins any fights and often winds up getting rolled off a ledge in the process. Snugs'&reg; lack of bulk allows him to bounce off several objects at a time without actually incurring any damage to himself or others. It may seem impolite of me to say, but he definitely seems to be the least intelligent of the bunch. He often appears oblivious to his surroundings and absolutely okay with that. Bugs&reg; goes with the moment and frequently follows in the footsteps of the other boys, going where they go and doing what they do. He is a tiny bundle of fuzz and I could not love him more.
