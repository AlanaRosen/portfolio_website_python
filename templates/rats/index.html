          <h4 class="card-title">Button</h4>
          <p class="card-text">Button is the peacemaker of the family, and generally one of the most chill rats you'll ever meet. He's skinnier than both Biscuit and Creamsicle, but he won't hesitate to put his whole body in the way if they start to fight too much. He has a habit of counteracting any negative feelings with cuddles, and it works a treat. Button also loves his scritches and is one of the few boys that will hold still while I rub his little head. His bravery and unwavering chill seem to be the reasons he runs this mischief.</p>

          <h4 class="card-title">Creamsicle</h4>
          <p class="card-text">Creamsicle is the second-in-command, and the most likely to get his ass whooped. He's given me many scares over time as he gets injured in play fights that he refuses to concede. He is absolutely huge, and a total sweetheart. I get kisses from him on the regular and he is one of the first to rush the cage doors whenever I'm near. Creamsicle is remarkably trusting despite his repeated beatings, and he will gladly plop his big belly down with any boy who holds still long enough to be considered a potential cuddle partner.</p>

          <p class="card-text">Narko is the oldest of his mischief, but only by a few months. He also happens to be the father of the other three, and he takes that authority seriously. He is a very intense, curious, brave, gorgeous, jerk - and we all love him. He will get aggressive if anyone has a treat and he doesn't, and he does NOT share toys. He does, however, cuddle amazingly well with his sons and have a habit of trying to shove his face up my nostrils. There is no lack of personality in this guy, even though he is the smallest of his mischief and likely pretty low in the power structure.</p>

          <h4 class="card-title">Biscuit</h4>
          <p class="card-text">Biscuit is last in the hierarchy while also being the biggest and not seeming to care at all about either. He is incredibly friendly and curious and will try to shove himself through the cage bars to get to me when he senses I'm near. Biscuit loves a good cuddle, but his favorite buddy is Creamsicle, and they spend a lot of time being fuzzy bros together and breaking my heart with all the cute. He also has a tendency to smell like brownies, and I have absolutely no idea why.</p>

          <h4 class="card-title">Opal</h4>
          <p class="card-text">Opal is the biggest of Isaac's Posse and the only dumbo of the group. Named for the cute white dot on his forehead, he is certainly a gem in his own right. When being held, Opal absolutely loves to curl up against my neck and make happy noises while I go about my business. He has little interest in exploring and mainly wishes to sleep and cuddle, which is absolutely fine by me. I always assumed he was low in the power structure due to the fact that I never saw him play fight like the others. However, when I attempted to join my mischiefs, Opal went ahead and beat the bricks off every boy in town - except Isaac. Isaac was absolutely terrified from the start and Opal protected him with a fiercness that showed very clearly that he was in charge and worthy of the status. Opal is a very persistent groomer, and will often help me with any manicuring I wasn't aware I needed. But hey, I'm not about to be mad at good hygiene.</p>

          <h4 class="card-title">Isaac</h4>
          <p class="card-text">Isaac and his posse are not related to my other boys, and he plans to keep their associations vague at best. While Isaac is potentially the most affectionate rat I have ever met in my life, he is also remarkably territorial if any rat outside of his mischief comes near. Kisses are a specialty - nay, a necessity. Isaac loves exploring and has been an escape artist since he was a baby. Constantly curious and ready to see the world, Isaac is the only rat I have that gets to explore outside. He loves the grass and will run every direction, but never more than two feet away from momma's feet. When he's done, Isaac will climb up my body and reclaim his place on my shoulder, letting me know he's ready to tell his buddies all about The Great Outdoors.</p>

Scribe is actually the father of all my other boys, and he earned his name due to his affinity for gnawing on books while I read them. He is just a sleepy potato filled with the most content love I have ever seen in my life. He spends most of his time lounging around looking chunky or eating to maintain said chunk. Scribe loves to witness the world from a shoulder's perspective and will show his appreciation with kisses all over. He is the only remaining rat of my original three, and I feel I have the deepest bond with him. There is no more kind or gentle creature on this earth than my beloved Pagemaster.

          <p class="card-text">Next, there's Trinidad. Often preferring to keep his own company, Trinidad is more timid and reserved than the other boys. He is always cautious in leaving the cage and moves slowly and carefully on unfamiliar terrain. Owing to his size, Trinidad seems to be the second-in-command to Scribe, easily dominating the other sons with his determination and bulk. But don't think any of this makes him unfriendly! Once he feels comfortable, he can be a funny, sweet, love-y boy just like the rest.

He loves jumping around from hammock to hammock within his cage and takes absolutely every possible opportunity he can find to be held. Crimson is a born explorer and kiss fanatic - once he gets ahold of you, you are getting slathered in love and there is nothing you can do to stop that. Curiosity often gets the better of him, as Crimson has been known to make some terrifying leaps in order to sate his wandering mind. I definitely have to keep an eye on him.

          <p class="card-text">Tiger is fourth in the hierarchy and remains the rat most similar to a human that I think I have ever met. Something about his demeanor says that he knows what's going on and he's okay with it most of the time. He has always been a fairly content rat, seemingly needing nothing but love and lots of corn. As he ages, Tiger becomes more and more like his father every day, preferring now to nap rather than play around with his brothers. Whenever he is held, Tiger spends the majority of his time exploring my hair and ears as opposed to the world around him. His affection for me is blatant, as is mine for him. Tiger has always been outgoing and accepting and never turns down a cuddle pile. His cuteness knows no bounds, and he is always willing to share his bed with any and all oncomers.

          <p class="card-text">Last but not least, we have SnuggleBug. Snugs is the smallest of the boys, and I am thankful for that every single day. Not being the most elegant of creatures, I frequently find Snuggle Bug falling feet at a time after slipping off a platform or jumping to a hammock and missing. He loves to play with his brothers, but never really wins any fights and often winds up getting rolled off a ledge in the process. Snugs' lack of bulk allows him to bounce off several objects at a time without actually incurring any damage to himself or others. It may seem impolite of me to say, but he definitely seems to be the least intelligent of the bunch. He often appears oblivious to his surroundings and absolutely okay with that. Bugs goes with the moment and frequently follows in the footsteps of the other boys, going where they go and doing what they do. He is a tiny bundle of fuzz and I could not love him more.

He never hesitates to push to the front of the line when it's time for treats, and he is not afraid to walk on someone's face in order to get them. Nicodemus gets super intense with treats, but is the most skiddish of all my boys when it comes time for affection. He has a blunted tail with a permanent crick in it from where his mom accidentally broke it when he was a baby, but it causes him no logistical difficulties. Nicodemus is one heck of a jumper and loves to work his way into the darkest of nooks and crannies.

      Well, in January of 2018, I was lonely. I am quite allergic to all animals (most plants and basic universal elements, as well), so I could not have a pet. It wasn't until one sad day when I posted on Facebook about my predicament that rats became an idea. I had several friends from high school tell me what excellent pets they made and how cuddly and personable they can be. At the time, it seemed like a decent idea, so I went for it. Little did I know, it would be one of the best decisions I have ever made.

      I went to a local pet store and bought three (I have OCD and can only deal with things in odd numbers - three being my favorite) feeder rats (the kind they usually keep for people with snakes). I requested three boys, as the research showed them to be much more calm and affectionate (the girls are smarter and easier to train - yes you can train rats - but I love my cuddlers). At the time, the store assistant told me, "Yeah, I think these are all boys."

      I took my gorgeous rats home and introduced them to their new cage and play area and watched them promptly escape from all of it. I spent months being outsmarted by three young rats (they weren't even full-grown yet, so they had to be less than six months old), and I am only slightly ashamed to admit that. It was after a couple months that I noticed two of my rats get suddenly rounder - not bigger, just round. I did some more research and discovered that I had been given two girl rats and one boy, and they were pregnant. The internet also informed me at that time that once rats are visibly pregnant, they will give birth within the week.

      I got all the necessary supplies together, separated the preggos, and waited. For five days, I did not spend more than 90 minutes at a time sleeping for fear of missing the magical birth. I was quite cranky by the time the big moment came, but it was totally worth it. I watched my sweet girls (named Doyle and Faust) give birth, each of them to a dozen magnificent babes! I've never seen anything like it and I loved every second of it. It was only after the birth that I realized my wonderful little family had just gone from 3 to 27.

      After I relearned how to breathe, I started preparing several larger cages (improvising two of them out of my dresser which I dismantled for this purpose) in anticipation of the horde of rodents I now had on my hands. For the first three weeks, mommies and babies all stayed in the birthing cage together, constantly eating and sleeping and being just about the cutest things that have ever existed. Doyle and Faust decided early on that it would be easier to co-parent the babies than try to keep them separate (also, they kept stealing each other's babies thinking one of theirs had gotten out of the nest), so they would take turns nursing while the other escaped to a higher level to get some peace. Every single day, I got to hold and play with these delightful pups (I referred to them as wiggle-beans, which I feel is pretty appropriate), making sure they were all healthy and getting fed. By three weeks, they had grown so much that I had to move them to the larger cages and separate them. I had learned online that the sexes needed to be separated by six weeks, as they are sexually mature at that point and WILL start breeding. Luckily for me, even at three weeks, it was easy to tell which babies were boys and which were girls. Doyle stayed with her sons while I left Faust to handle the ladies.

      During their first six weeks, I frantically scrambled to find homes for all these rats! I struck gold through Facebook (again) and found several people to take a few each, which would slowly whittle my numbers considerably. Within a month of them being weaned, I was down to eleven rats (six girls not including the mothers and five boys including the father). I had grown so attached to these 11 that I simply could not give any more of them away.

      Now, if I had gotten my boys fixed, I could have kept them in the same cage with their sisters and it would not have been a problem. However, I cannot even fathom how much money that would cost, so I came up with a different solution: Instead of having two large cages and eleven rats in my studio apartment (you can only imagine how difficult the smells were to combat), my partner, Cadale, took the six girls. Conveniently, he lives about two blocks down the road from me, so I get to visit my girls any time I like. The five boys stayed with me, and we all couldn't be a happier family.
