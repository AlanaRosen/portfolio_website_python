        Well, in January of 2018, I was lonely. I am quite allergic to all animals (most plants and basic universal elements, as well), so I could not have a pet. It wasn't until one sad day when I posted on Facebook about my predicament that rats became an idea. I had several friends from high school tell me what excellent pets they made and how cuddly and personable they can be. At the time, it seemed like a decent idea, so I went for it. Little did I know, it would be one of the best decisions I have ever made.

        I went to a local pet store and bought three (I have OCD and can only deal with things in odd numbers - three being my favorite) feeder rats (the kind they usually keep for people with snakes). I requested three boys, as the research showed them to be much more calm and affectionate (the girls are smarter and easier to train - yes you can train rats - but I love my cuddlers). At the time, the store assistant told me, "Yeah, I think these are all boys."

        I took my gorgeous rats home and introduced them to their new cage and play area and watched them promptly escape from all of it. I spent months being outsmarted by three young rats (they weren't even full-grown yet, so they had to be less than six months old), and I am only slightly ashamed to admit that. It was after a couple months that I noticed two of my rats get suddenly rounder - not bigger, just round. I did some more research and discovered that I had been given two girl rats and one boy, and they were pregnant. The internet also informed me at that time that once rats are visibly pregnant, they will give birth within the week.

        I got all the necessary supplies together, separated the preggos, and waited. For five days, I did not spend more than 90 minutes at a time sleeping for fear of missing the magical birth. I was quite cranky by the time the big moment came, but it was totally worth it. I watched my sweet girls (named Doyle and Faust) give birth, each of them to a dozen magnificent babes! I've never seen anything like it and I loved every second of it. It was only after the birth that I realized my wonderful little family had just gone from 3 to 27.

        After I relearned how to breathe, I started preparing several larger cages (improvising two of them out of my dresser which I dismantled for this purpose) in anticipation of the horde of rodents I now had on my hands. For the first three weeks, mommies and babies all stayed in the birthing cage together, constantly eating and sleeping and being just about the cutest things that have ever existed. Doyle and Faust decided early on that it would be easier to co-parent the babies than try to keep them separate (also, they kept stealing each other's babies thinking one of theirs had gotten out of the nest), so they would take turns nursing while the other escaped to a higher level to get some peace. Every single day, I got to hold and play with these delightful pups (I referred to them as wiggle-beans, which I feel is pretty appropriate), making sure they were all healthy and getting fed. By three weeks, they had grown so much that I had to move them to the larger cages and separate them. I had learned online that the sexes needed to be separated by six weeks, as they are sexually mature at that point and WILL start breeding. Luckily for me, even at three weeks, it was easy to tell which babies were boys and which were girls. Doyle stayed with her sons while I left Faust to handle the ladies.

        During their first six weeks, I frantically scrambled to find homes for all these rats! I struck gold through Facebook (again) and found several people to take a few each, which would slowly whittle my numbers considerably. Within a month of them being weaned, I was down to eleven rats (six girls not including the mothers and five boys including the father). I had grown so attached to these 11 that I simply could not give any more of them away.

        Now, if I had gotten my boys fixed, I could have kept them in the same cage with their sisters and it would not have been a problem. However, I cannot even fathom how much money that would cost, so I came up with a different solution: Instead of having two large cages and eleven rats in my studio apartment (you can only imagine how difficult the smells were to combat), my partner, Cadale, took the six girls. Conveniently, he lives about two blocks down the road from me, so I get to visit my girls any time I like. The five boys stayed with me, and we all couldn't be a happier family.
